This Java application represents an architecture showcase for an application which is implemented with ideas from DDD and Clean Architecture.

It consists of an client app based on JavaFX/Gluon (ready for cross compiling on different platforms) and a server part based on Quarkus (which exposes its functionality with some RESTful endpoints and a tiny UI created with JSF).

== Domain

The technical basis is a bookstore "publishing company". In the bookstore, various publications (books or blog posts) are managed for authors.

The following sketch provides an overview of the domain:

== Architecture

The showcase combines ideas from the two standard works "Domain Driven Design" and "Clean Architecture".

The package structure is based on the BCE concept (boundary control entity) to enable a simple and standardized structure.

All 3 concepts mentioned complement each other perfectly, for the combination of Clean Architecture (indicated as hexagonal in the article, but the basic idea is the same) and BCE, the following link offers a good start: http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~pearce/modules/patterns/enterprise/ecb/ecb.htm .

Shown schematically, the application is structured as follows:
