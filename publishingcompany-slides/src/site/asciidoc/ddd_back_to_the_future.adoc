== Introduction

[%step]
* Speaker of the day: *Konrad Renner*
* Day to day job: *Software Architect at ARZ Allgemeines Rechenzentrum GmbH*
* Some personal things: *Linux / Java / DDD / Open Source / OpenHab / Star Wars / BBQ* enthusiast
* Direct link to digital life: *link:github.com/konradrenner[GitHub - konradrenner]*

== Agenda

[%step]
* What is it about?
* How can this time travel help us?
* Are there other crazy ideas Doc?
* Sounds pretty heavy. How does this all come together?
* Let me know what you think about all this

== What is it about?

[%step]
* Ubiquitous Language
* Distillation and Context
* Refactoring toward deeper insight

* *Ubiquitous Language most important part*
** Hard to define und extract, much work is needed
** It always has a Context where it is "valid"
** Example: Doc Browns DeLorean DMC-12
*** When Doc Brown talks about a timemachine, he means his DMC-12
*** When a mechanic gets his fingers on the DMC-12, he is repairing a car
* *Distillation and Context*
** You can think about Problem space and Solution Space
** _Distillation_: Distill the core domain out of your business domain
** Put most of your effort in your core domain
** _Context_: The area in which a word or some kind of "structure" has the same meaning everywhere
** Example: Doc Browns DeLorean DMC-12
*** Core Domain is the timetravel functionality
*** Subdomain is, that the DeLorean is possible to drive
*** Both need energy to function
**** In case of the driving functionality there just has to be any engine
**** But in case of the timetravel functionality there must be an atomic reactor
**** So in one case, the solution is "any engine" and in the other case it is "atomic reactor"
* *Refactoring toward deeper insight*
** Design and implementation is an ongoing process
** Agile and DDD are a perfect match

=== Strategic and Tactical Design

--
* Strategic Design
** "Big Picture"
** Communication paths betweens contexts
* Tactical Design
** Model within a Bounded Context
* _Examples for technical communication discusions will come in the next slides!_

=== DDD for "cloud native software architecture"

[%step]
* Focus on your core domain, not technical aspects
* Put all relevant stakeholder together
** Establish a common understanding of strategic AND tactical design
* Build Microservices/Self-Contained-Systems based on Bounded Context
** Maybe a Bounded Context can also help by defining K8s Namespaces ;-)

--
* One of the most common questions in my day to day work is, how to size Microservices or siblings (e.g. SCS)
** Just use the Bounded Contexts
* The Context Map helps to understand how communication flows through the system
** The relationship types helps in discusions about the technical communication
*** Shared Kernel: Create a library
*** Open Host Service: Maybe RESTful with OpenAPI powered Published Language

== Sounds pretty heavy. How does this all come together?

* Docs as Code
* DevSecOps
* Bounded Context - Microservice - K8s Namespace
