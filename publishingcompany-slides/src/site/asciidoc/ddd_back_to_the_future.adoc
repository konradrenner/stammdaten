<<<<
== What is it about?

[%step]
* Ubiquitous Language
* Distillation and Context
* Refactoring toward deeper insight

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* *Ubiquitous Language most important part*
** Ubiquitous: appearing everywhere => users, architects, product owner, developer and of course in code too
** The meanings of words are "context sensitive"
* *Distillation and Context*
** You can think about Problem space and Solution Space
** Example: Problem Space - How to build a time machine; Solution Space - How a time machine is actually built
** _Distillation_: Distill the core domain out of your business domain
** Put most of your effort in your core domain
** Example Distillation: Doc Browns DeLorean DMC-12
*** Core Domain is the timetravel functionality
*** Subdomain is, that the DeLorean is possible to drive
** _Context_: The area in which a word or some kind of "structure" has the same meaning everywhere
** Example Context: Doc Browns DeLorean DMC-12
*** When Doc Brown talks about a timemachine, he means his DMC-12
*** When a mechanic gets his fingers on the DMC-12, he is repairing a car
* *Refactoring toward deeper insight*
** Design and implementation is an ongoing process
** Agile and DDD are a perfect match
** Think of products, not projects

=== Strategic and Tactical Design

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* *Strategic Design*
** "Big Picture"
** Communication paths betweens contexts
* *Tactical Design*
** Model within a Bounded Context
** Aggregates not just encapsulate, they are also important for consistency
*** Aggregates map nicely to the concept of entities as described in the position paper link:https://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/papers/cidr07p15.pdf[Life beyond distributed transactions]
* _Examples for technical communication possibilities will come in the next slides!_

== How can this time travel help us?

image::tragedy.jpg[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* There is a tragedy that not only concerns Marty McFly and Doc Brown, but also a galaxy far, far away 
* First part of the tragedy could be a misunderstanding of the domain because: *_"It’s developer’s understanding, not expert knowledge that gets released into production"_* - Alberto Brandolini
* The second part of the tragedy could be, that the cut of Microservices was based on an inappropriate approach
* Inappropriate approaches would be:
** Pure technical
** Based on organizational circumstances
--

<<<<
=== What would it look like?

image::monolith.jpg[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Because *inappropriate cut Microservices can lead to unnecessary or even dangerous remote communication*
* One might think that the "smaller" a microservice is, the less complex it is
** This is true for the local complexity of this specific microservice, but it is not true for the whole system
** The smaller a microservice is cut, the more communication with other services is necessary and this in turn increases the complexity of the overall system
*** The much more important type of complexity is global complexity (the complexity of the whole system) because it has a much higher impact on different non-functional requirements on the whole system, than one part ot the whole system
*** It's less about black and white thinking (monolith vs microservice) and more about creating a balance
* In the worst case you transform a "local" monolithic app (local from a transactional view), to a distributed monolithic app (distributed transactions)
** As stated above: too high global complexity is worse then local complexity
** Sooner or later this will lead to a real resilience tragedy (e.g. Deadlocks)
** Beware: Local monoliths do not necessarily have to be bad, but distributed monoliths are problematic most of the time!
* Service Mesh and similar solutions are often only symptom treatments, but do not solve the problems at the cause
** But of course solving many security problems (e.g. Zero Trust with mTLS) and link:https://devopscon.io/blog/service-mesh-vs-framework-resilience-in-distributed-systems-with-istio-or-hystrix/[resilience problems] on the infrastructure layer
* So this "time travel" to the 2004 book, can help us find more effective approach
** As the book subtitle states: Tackling complexity in the heart of software
** In the next couple of slides I will show you some of the concepts, to minimize the propability that such tragedies will occur

=== DDD for "cloud native software architecture"

[%step]
* *Focus on your core domain, not technical aspects*
* Establish a common understanding of strategic AND tactical design
** *Merge the people, split the software*
* Build Microservices or Self-Contained-Systems based on Bounded Context
** Maybe a Bounded Context can also help by defining K8s Namespaces ;-)

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* One of the most common questions in my day to day work is, how to size Microservices or siblings (e.g. SCS)
** Just use the Bounded Contexts

* *The Context Map helps to understand how communication flows through the system*
** The relationship types helps in discusions about the technical communication
*** Confirmist 
**** Upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team’s need
**** Maybe a lib, which is developed without regard to the downstream (maybe because it was create for another downstream in form of a customer-supplier relationship)
*** Open Host Service
**** Access to a system is provided by clearly defined services, using a clearly defined protocol
**** Maybe RESTful services with OpenAPI powered Published Language

== Are there other crazy ideas Doc?

[%step]
* _Disclaimer:_ The following tooling are just my personal favorites
* Start with link:https://www.eventstorming.com/[Event Storming]
* Document architecture with link:https://arc42.org/overview[arc42 template]
* Take out the pain of documentation with link:https://docs-as-co.de/[Documentation As Code]
* Structure code on basis of link:https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html[Clean Architecture]

=== Event Storming

image::level-of-storming.png[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* *The key idea of EventStorming is*
. *See the system as a whole* 
. Find a problem worth solving (Distillation)
. Gather the best immediately available information
. Start implementing a solution from the best possible starting point (Context)
* You just need a room with a long enough wall, many coloured stickies, something to write, the "right" people (and no table in the middle)
* Invite all relevant stakeholder in the room
** They put their view in brain storming fashion on an "endless" wall, in form of events
** Events are always past tense
** They discuss the outcomes
*** Consensus is not required, it could be a signal for different meanings of an event; mark heavy discussion with a hotspot sticky
* *Start with a Big Picture workshop*
** Helps crossing knowledge silo boundaries
** You get many hints about possible Bounded Contexts
* *Then you can start modelling your processes* in the contexts with the integration of commands, policies and read models
** Picture that explain (nearly) everthing (see picture in next slide)
* *And then you could dive even deeper into Software Design* (for discovering/designing Aggregates)
** Aggregates are the "state machines" between commands and events
** It is not just Process Modelling with Aggregates because many processes can be connected with an Aggregate (think of a combination of processes with focus on Aggregates)
** Think of behavior, not data!
* But be aware, that every time you dive deeper, the required person's will change. And maybe you have to step back at some point of time
** Have a look at chapters "system scope and context" and "building block views" and "runtime views" of arc42, if you are interested in how to document outcomes

=== Event Storming

image::event_storming_2.png[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* _Yellow_: People, Actor or Persona
* _Blue_: Command or Action (triggered from people, system or time based event)
* _Orange_: Event (consists at least of a noun and past tense verb)
* _Purple_: Policy or Business Rule, glue between event and thereafter command(Whenever [event(s)] the [command(s]) 
* _Green_: Read Model (information/data that needs to be available to take a given decision)
* _Pink_: (External) System or part of a system 
* _Red_: HotSpot (open question, noticed for later discussion)
* Precise Notation or explorations are not required and could harm creativity (e.g. it is not important if the yellow means people or Persona)

=== Clean Architecture

image::CleanArchitecture.jpeg[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The most important part is flow of control
** *Never ever make inner circles depend on outer!*
** Technical aspects must never enter the domain logic
*** If so: your code will e.g. not be unit testable (you cannot mock away technical aspects sufficient)
* This architecture perfectly fits with the "Layered Architecture" and Tactical design as described in the DDD book
** *Enterprise Business Rules*: _Entities and Aggregates_
** *Application Business Rules*: _Domain Services, Repository contracts_ (e.g. Java Interface)
** *Interface Adapters*: _Repository implementations_
* An example is just 2 slides away

== Sounds pretty heavy. How does this all come together?

[%step]
* link:https://github.com/konradrenner/stammdaten/blob/master/README.adoc[publishing-company example]
* Uses link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] as _"Kubernetes native Java stack"_
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary[Boundary-Control-Entity] pattern for implementing "lightweight" Clean Architecture on top of DDD
* Architecture automatically checked with link:https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Some think, Java is not the cool or hip enough nowadays
** They did not try Quarkus yet
** rock solid tooling, massive community, native performance and state of the art dev experience
* DDD and Clean Architecture are a perfect match
** Use BCE and you also get a standardized und clear structuring of your projects
*** *Boundary*: _Interface Adapters_
*** *Control*: _Application Business Rules_
*** *Entity*: _Enterprise Business Rules_
* Let the tooling do the "boring" work for you
** Automatic versioning and releasing
** Automatic publishing
** Automatic testing
* The (Git) Repo is the single source of truth for all aspects
** Architecture, Security, Code, Config
** Every change is tracked in your favorite VCS and absolutly traceable
** Maybe you *use GitOps to further improve automation*

=== Time for an example

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Disclaimer: The link:https://github.com/konradrenner/stammdaten/blob/master/README.adoc[publishing-company example] has just little todo with back to the future :-) (one book entry)
* This example "lives", so it is in parts unfinished an will change from time to time
* It demonstrates all of the tools discussed, except context mapping
** It just contains the "Author Aggregate" from the "Author Context" (1:1 mapping)
* It consists of an Web UI (JSF), REST API and an Cross Compiled Mobile/Desktop Companion App

== But...

* _Organizations which design systems […] are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations._ - Melvin E. Conway
* Have a look at link:https://teamtopologies.com/[Team Topologies]
** Approach to modern software delivery with awareness of
*** Conway’s Law, team cognitive load and responsive organization evolution

<<<<
=== Team Topologies

image::team-topologies.png[]

// Press the `*s*` key to access speaker notes.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
* *Like DDD it "just" formalizes some good practices and ideas*
* *Stream aligned teams* are the "heart" because the are aligned on value streams
** These are based on top of the DevOps ideas
** The other teams are "just" supporting them in which they take away cognitive load
** So the other team types are just required, if the cognitive load will get to high for a stream aligned teams
** The other teams may consists "internally" also of stream aligned teams 
* *Complicated subsystem team*:
** Parts of the system which not directly mapped to the value stream, but are a requirement "to function"
** Think on the flux capacitor: one team just focuses on this complicated part, whereas the stream aligned teams will do improvements on the integration with the Delorean
* *Enabling team*:
** Disclaimer: This is not Architecture Department, but a team of specialists
** They help to spread knowledge about new things in the organization and tech world
** They also evaluate if "trends" are applyable and how
* *Platform team*:
** They are building and maintain e.g. the tools which are required, so that stream aligned teams can work effective AND efficient
** Think on the Delorean: A Platform team would have built it and will repair things, whereas the stream aligned teams will focus on the time travel functionalities
* The interaction modes helps visualising and so understanding the dependencies between teams
** *Collaboration*: strong delivery dependencies (e.g. stream aligned and complicated subsystem team)
** *X as a Service*: Decoupling and standardization (mostly used when interaction with a platform team is needed)
** *Facilitating*: helping or being helped by another team (mostly the case when a stream aligned teams "gets knowledge" from an enabling team)

* Thank you for the possibilty to share my thoughts on this topic
* In closing, I have only two things to say
** Never stop refactoring, there is no "perfect" or "everlasting" solution
*** _Software development is a learning process, working code is a nice side effect_
** And: *may the force be with you*
