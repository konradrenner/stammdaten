== Architecture Decisions

link:https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Architecture Decision Record] is a great format to document decisions. But they should be organized separately from this document und just be included (use asciidoc also for the records and everything will be hassle free). The benefits are, that you can publish they separately and they are easier to find outside this document.

Don't forget to add a section "Compliance", so that one can understand how it is checked that the decision will be complied (code snippet to link:https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit Tests], four-eyes principle threw pull requests, and so on).

For further Information see https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.

There you will find links and examples about ADR.
