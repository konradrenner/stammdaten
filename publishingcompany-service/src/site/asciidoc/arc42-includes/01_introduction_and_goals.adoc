== Introduction and Goals

This Java application represents an architecture showcase for an application which is implemented with ideas from DDD and Clean Architecture.

It consists of an client app based on JavaFX/Gluon (ready for cross compiling on different platforms, e.g. with link:https://gluonhq.com/use-github-actions-to-automate-your-gluon-build-and-release-cycle/[GitHub Actions]) and a server part based on Quarkus (which exposes its functionality with some RESTful endpoints and a tiny UI created with JSF).

This document is based on the arc42 template but only uses the parts of the template to exemplify how the ideas of DDD can be connected to it.
