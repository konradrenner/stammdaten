== Architecture Constraints
TODO Link arc42, no extension needed in this chapter 
The showcase combines ideas from the two standard works "link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_Design[Domain Driven Design]" and "link:https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html[Clean Architecture]".

The package structure is based on the link:http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~pearce/modules/patterns/enterprise/ecb/ecb.htm[BCE concept] (boundary control entity) to enable a simple and standardized structure.

For further Information see https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.
