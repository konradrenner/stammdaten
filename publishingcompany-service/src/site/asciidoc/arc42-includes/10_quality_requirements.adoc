== Quality Requirements

Quality goals and quality requirements can be derived using Big Picture Event Storming workshops.

These arise either implicitly, e.g. through external systems (keyword interoperability) or can be explicitly represented, e.g. through hotspots.

Results from process modeling workshops can be used as a basis for quality scenarios.  In the form of an additional description, the connection to quality requirements can subsequently be established.

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.
